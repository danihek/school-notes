# Japanese Writing Systems

Modern Japanese writing system uses a combination of logographic kanji, which are adopted Chinese Characters and syllabic kana.
Kana itself consists of pair of syllaberies:
- [Hiragana](./01.Hiragana.md), used primarily for native or naturalized Japanese words and grammatical elements;
- [Kana](./02.Katakana.md) used primarily for foreign words and names, loanwords, onomatopoeia, scientific names etc;

Almost all written Japanese sentences contain a mixture of kanji and kana. Because of this mixture of scripts, in addition to a large inventory of kanji characters **(well over 50,000)**, the Japanese writing system is considered to be one of the most complicated currently in use.
